I built this [app](https://github.com/haouaenikoyeJavaScript-github-finder-App/) using github API. It searchs for github users by their username, give us their profile and all the information like List of
their latest 5 public repositories and links to them.

- ES6 Classes
- Fetch API
- ES7/ES8 Async + Await
